This CTIN Repository has been created in support of the upcoming Cybersecurity Automation Workshop to be held June 2, 2022.

Cyber Threat Intelligence Network, Inc. (CTIN) brings innovation to the cyber threat intelligence space by combining traditional cyber threat intelligence (CTI) with digital risk protection services (DRPS).  For the former we use state-of-the-art tools and protocols to collect, curate and disseminate alerts on cyber security threats. For the later we use aggregator tools for social media and influence operations monitoring, automating our processes to improve coverage and effectiveness.  CTIN is a U.S. Delaware C-Corp with partners in the US, Finland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Our principals are well recognized specialists in threat intelligence in NATO and aligned countries.  

For the purpose of the Automation Workshop Repository items will include sample Use Cases from open sources documenting actual exploits of vulnerabilities listed on the US DHS/CISA Top Vulnerabilities list for 2021. To the extent possible Use Cases will be based on:

Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors as characterized by the MITRE Corporation ATT&CK Framework
STIX2.1 formatted data (STIX domain objects [SDOs] and STIX cyber observables [SCOs])
Additional relevant information from other published knowledge bases such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) (https://cwe.mitre.org/)
A narrative that adds context to the Use Case for capture by workshop participants.
