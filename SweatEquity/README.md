# Sweat Equity
this directory is for organizations to
document what they will hopefully
(no commitment, this is for planning purposes)
be providing for the workshop.

The following participants have agreed
to bring systems to the workshop for
the purpose of interoperating
as part of the stated use cases.
Click on a participants link
for more information on what they
will be providing:
- [sFractal](./sFractal/README.md)
- [DoD](./DoD/README.md)
- [HII](HII/README.md)
- [University of Oslo](./UniversityOslo/README.md)
- [Linux Foundation](./LinuxFoundation/README.md)
- [Cybeats](./Cybeats/README.md)
- [Copado](./Copado/README.md)
- [CTIN](./CTIN/README.md)

A procedural note about modifying this
and subtending dirs/pages:
- Pull Requests to modify a participant's page should only be made by the participant
or with their express permission.
- If you plan to bring something to the workshop, make a Pull Request:
   + adding your org to the end of the list
   + make a subdirectory
   + make a README.md in the subdirectory
   + note that initially just creating the file is sufficient. Details can get filled in over time
