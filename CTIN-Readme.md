This Repository has been created in support of the upcoming Cybersecurity Automation Workshop to be held June 2, 2022.

Repository items will include sample Use Cases from open sources documenting actual exploits of vulnerabilities listed on the US DHS/CISA Top Vulnerabilities list for 2021. To the extent possible Use Cases will be based on:

1. Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actors as characterized by the MITRE Corporation ATT&CK Framework
2. STIX2.1 formatted data (STIX domain objects [SDOs] and STIX cyber observables [SCOs])
3. Additional relevant information from other published knowledge bases such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) (https://cwe.mitre.org/)
4. A narrative that adds context to the Use Case for capture by workshop participants.

A candidate vulnerability for the first Use Case is CVE-2021-44228, popularly known as Log4Shell.  Using the naming convention of CrowdStrike, the following threat actors were seen actively exploiting this vulnerability between December 9th, 2021 and December 31, 2021.
